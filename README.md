# Malware Analysis Project

## Introduction
Welcome to the Malware Analysis Project. This repository contains tools, methodologies, and sample malware used for educational and research purposes in the field of cybersecurity. The objective of this project is to analyze various types of malware to understand their behavior, propagation methods, and the potential impact on infected systems.

## Warning and Responsibility Statement
**Warning:** This project involves the use of actual malware samples. Handling malware poses a significant risk to your system and network. It is crucial to conduct all analysis in a controlled, isolated environment such as a virtual machine with no network connectivity to avoid accidental spread.

**Responsibility Statement:** The author and contributors to this project are not responsible for any damage or misuse of the malware samples. Use this repository at your own risk and ensure you have the necessary precautions in place.

## Tools and Technologies
The following tools and technologies are used in this project:
- **Disassemblers and Debuggers:**
  - IDA Pro
  - Ghidra
  - OllyDbg
- **Network Analysis Tools:**
  - Wireshark
  - Fiddler
- **Sandbox Environments:**
  - Cuckoo Sandbox
  - Hybrid Analysis
- **Static Analysis Tools:**
  - PEiD
  - Dependency Walker
- **Dynamic Analysis Tools:**
  - Process Monitor
  - Regshot

## Methodology
1. **Sample Collection:** Obtain malware samples from reliable sources.
2. **Environment Setup:** Configure a virtual machine for safe analysis.
3. **Static Analysis:** Analyze the malware binary without execution.
4. **Dynamic Analysis:** Execute the malware in a controlled environment to observe behavior.
5. **Network Analysis:** Monitor network traffic generated by the malware.
6. **Report Generation:** Document findings and insights from the analysis.
